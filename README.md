# Mirko-Mileski-PDFgen

A tool for generating certificates of regularity for students studying at ОСУ Мирко Милески – Кичево. Created as a desktop app using C# and WPF, the UI is built with the help of XAML and Visual Studio’s built-in designer. It incorporates the open-source Modern UI for WPF (MUI). Info about the students is kept in a (local) database, and the iText library is used to generate the end PDF from a given template.
